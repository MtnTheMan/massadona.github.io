Welcome to Massadona Co.

I am personally driven by a vision of natural resource stewardship that bridges rigorous science with community-centered practice. This website is a part of an effort to have some creative outlet. My professional ambition is to foster resilient landscapes by integrating high-resolution spatial analysis, stakeholder engagement, and policy insight into land management.

For a complete biography, detailed project descriptions, and all contact information (email, social media, professional and academic projects), please visit my 'home' site at [mtntheman.com](https://mtntheman.com).
